## Why

My audience spans Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, and Discord. Publishing consistently while building products requires ruthless automation, so I created a content OS that ingests ideas, drafts scripts, and schedules posts in under an hour.

## System

1. **Ideas inbox:** A Telegram bot collects prompts from Discord, Twitter, and user questions, tagging them by theme and priority.
2. **Script builder:** Next.js dashboard pulls the prompt, injects code snippets from my GitHub gists, and exports scenes directly to CapCut.
3. **Distribution:** Supabase cron jobs publish to YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, and schedule email recaps via Resend.

## Results

- 3x publishing cadence without adding editors.
- Real-time feedback loops from Discord analytics help me decide which Code Share drops to prioritize.
- Audience DM replies feed straight back into the product roadmap.
